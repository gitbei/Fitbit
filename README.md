ðŸ“Š Fitbit Data Analysis

In this quick mini-project, I conducted an analysis of Fitbit data by loading a text file containing the data and exploring it using NumPy's built-in functions. My goal was to investigate how mood impacts steps count and sleep patterns.
Using Python and NumPy, I analyzed the Fitbit data to uncover trends and correlations between mood, step count, and sleep duration. 

Stay tuned for more updates as I dive deeper into the analysis and uncover further insights from the Fitbit data!
